                <p1>Hi, my name is, JR Neigel. I am here today because I have had Big Dreams for quite some time and my Dad told me about 16 years ago that I should've joined the military for computers and not to be a Diesel Mechanic. I wish I could tell him to his face that he was right! I've been turning wrenches off and on since I was about 16 years old. When I joined the Army that's all I wanted to do, was to be a mechanic and build, and fix things. Now that I'm 33 years old, I've come to realize that the heavy equipment mechanic field was NOT the field I wanted to retire from. My dream car is pictured above and there will be some Internet found specificatioins below. Thanks!</p1>
